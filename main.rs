// For this analysis, I selected a dataset on dining table partners. It represents the choices 
// of the girls within a dormitory. Each node of the directed graph is converted into a specific girl (their name) 
// while each edge in this network resembled each girl's first choice of their top dining partner. I was interested in 
// finding out which girl was the most popular and interpret other patterns of social ties in this network. 
// I transferred the dataset into a graph by adding the edges using the source and target values. 
// I had mapped the node labels which originally was their names (strings) into numbers. 
// Then, with the graph, I was able to implement degree distribution where I looked into the number of nodes that 
// one specific node was connected to. Overall, it seems that Eva has the greatest amount of nodes, making her 
// the most popular choice. The remaining nodes split into a distribution that is slightly more even.
// Eva's choice is Maxine, who also has a decent number of connections. The Breadthâ€“First Search 
// algorithm interprets that the shortest path to get from Eva to Maxine would be just between themselves.
